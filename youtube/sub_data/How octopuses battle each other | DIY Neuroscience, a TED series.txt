the octopus is a rather strange looking animal that exhibits amazingly complex behaviors they have the most impressive nervous system in the entire invertebrate world they have about a half a billion neurons that are distributed throughout their body such that two-thirds of the neurons are actually in its legs now mix this thing with camouflaging cells jet propulsion and a razor-sharp beak and you have all the makings of a formidable predator and then throw in the fact that the octopus is a solitary creature and suddenly we have ourselves a real cephalopod fight  we know that almost all animals fight for food for territory or for mates and the octopus is no different and knowing they're fighting behavior could help us better understand these fascinating creatures and how they interact my friend Ilya has been observing the classic fighting behavior between the California - spotted octopus most people think that it's octopi but that's actually incorrect the correct plurals are either octopuses or octopod YZ if you want to be very Greek about it so how do you do your experiment first I like to set up the chamber just so it's ready so I get a jug of water I aerate it by shaking the jug it seems as if the water is well aerated they're a lot more active this gives the octopus some room to breathe I get the first octopus here buddy yeah put it in set up my GoPro put the second octopus in cover it up and leave it alone there's always one octopus on defense one on offense usually the one that's taking up more space that's more boastful definitely the aggressor most likely the winner of the fight the loser is pretty obvious they get pushed around they curl up hide in the corner a lot of the time when there's an initial contact if one of them is too much on the defensive side the second one will sort of poke at it rabbit its tentacle and see hey do you want to fight me do you want to turn around do you want to start a wrestling match so we'll just poke and run away come back poke and run away  when the octopus come towards each other to begin the fight they don't actually face each other they approach sideways the defense of octopus tries to face away from the attacker until it's the critical moment it knows there's no way to avoid a fight really the one who's waiting the last moment is defensive he was the aggressor in a fight we'll quickly and sharply flash bright black on his arms when he is about to initiate a fight ooh and already we're seeing some action looks like this each other right so now he's going to become is approaching but not directly at it yeah they're like almost completely antiparallel and then right there yeah like contacts and then their arms clash together  so we've taken the first steps in understanding fighting in the octopus and you may be asking yourself why does this even matter well these types of curiosity based research question can often lead to some unexpected insights and discoveries and we've learned a lot about ourselves from studying marine animals squid have taught us about how our neurons communicate and the horseshoe crab has taught us about how our eyes work so it's not too far of a stretch to say that some of these behaviors that we're seeing in the California - spotted octopus are similar to arms [Music]
