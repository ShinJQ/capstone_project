everybody has that one friend you know the single-minded one the one who no matter what the question is always finds a way to make the answer whatever it is she single-minded about I'm that friend and the things that I'm single-minded about is racism if someone were to ask me so Janet got any plans for the 4th of July I'm subject to answer yeah I'm gonna binge-watch roots or if they said Janet got a joke for you why'd the chicken cross the road was it a black chicken probably gentrification  [Music] but for me single-mindedness is not just caring about something it's caring about something enough to do something about it it's not just thinking it's doing it's not just praying it is moving your feet and the reason I'm single minded about racism is because I know single mindedness can destroy it I learned that many many years ago back in 1984 I was a junior at Davidson College through Davidson north carolina now Davidson is a little bitty town southern town split by railroad tracks white Davidson on one side black Davidson on the other side and as black students living on the white side of the tracks we got used to being stopped in downtown and asked for ID until the police memorized our faces but fortunately that didn't take too long because of 1,200 students only 52 of us were black there was one black professor one black assistant dean things were a lot better on campus well I wasn't okay with this and so I started writing things and then I started yelling things and after about three years of that I got tired so I decided to write one more thing and I wrote something called project 87 project 87 was really just a challenge to Davidson in three years by 1987 in row 100 black students hired 10 black professors create five black Studies classes and hire one black Dean didn't seem particularly revolutionary but what was different about it was we also challenged Davidson to say that if you don't do this we will question your commitment to diversity it was a real problem we put some real numbers to it we gave him some real consequences well campus would absolutely nuts but fortunately in the middle of this Davidson got a new president and that president was single-minded about racism too and so he created a task force to address the issues in project 87 and several months after that we produced a 77 page report that report was the foundation for all the change they came after it now I wasn't there to see that change because actually in 1985 I graduated you are looking at the three happiest people on the planet that day because I am leaving however the change did happen and today there are a hundred eighty-five black students there are sixteen black or multiracial professors there are four black Dean's and there's an entire degree granting Africana Studies department  project 87 changed Davidson but it also changed me because what it taught me was there's a lot of power in single mindedness well today I'm an executive speechwriter for one of the biggest companies in the world it's a profession that is 92% white and predominantly male which makes me a little bit of a unicorn but I was single mind at unicorn so the thing about speech writing is it's very personal so I spend a lot of time in deep conversation with the CEO and senior executives and a lot of times those conversations turn to diversity and inclusion which of course I'm always happy to talk about but after quite a few of these conversations I've come to a conclusion I believe that business is in a position to do something that no other entity can do business can dismantle racism now colleges can't do it daren't with 5,000 of them in the United States and only 20 million students enrolled church can't do it either only 35 percent of us go on a regular basis and when we do 11 o'clock Sunday morning is the most segregated hour in America but business there are a hundred and sixty-two million people in the US workforce alone people of all races United in the spirit of wanting a paycheck and having to show up to get it now I'm aware that diversity is bigger than race and racism is bigger than America but racial discrimination is the most prominent form and Lord knows America is the absolute best at it so what if though what if we worked in divert diverse and inclusive environments then we had something to do something with and since we spend one third of our lives at work what if we did that with people who didn't look like us I think the world would be a totally different place outside of work that can happen if business gets single-minded about racism but now the question is how is that supposed to happen well I think there are three things that business can borrow from project 87 real problems real numbers real consequences like it or not diversity is not really a problem for business yet I mean it's a nice thing to have it's the right thing to do but for decades we've been trying to make the case that diversity fuels innovation and customer insight I mean at this point it's kind of a no-brainer a little bit like hearing a smoke alarm going off and standing there with your hand on the hot door waiting for some data to tell you that your house is on fire because the data is already there ethnically diverse companies perform 33 percent better than the norm Forbes is best workplaces for diversity enjoy 24% higher revenue growth and yet here we are in 2018 and there are only three black CEOs in the fortune 500 and if your name is Molly or Connor you got a 14% better chance of getting the car back on your resume than if your name is shanece or DeSean and all of this despite the fact that by 2045 America is projected to be a minority majority country here's the thing the business case for diversity as it stands today doesn't really speak to any problem and the only way business is going to get single-minded about racial diversity is if it has a problem that is urgent and relative to somebody other than people of color I got one how about employees and customers because no matter what business you're in you're gonna need those right well let's talk about some real numbers if you have employees and customers wouldn't it make sense if they looked a little bit like the people that work for you so if that's the case maybe your employee base should be 13 percent black and 18 percent Hispanic because that's what the population looks like maybe that's what your customer base looks like but let's be clear diversity and inclusion are not the same things diversity is a numbers game inclusion is about impact companies can mandate diversity but they have to cultivate inclusion and if inclusion is what you're after you got to calculate some slightly different numbers how about 30% because that's the point that research shows at which the voices of minorities actually begin to be heard if you want a real problem you've got any real numbers to fix it and if you're not willing to set real numbers then maybe you're not real serious about diversity inclusion that brings me to my third point real consequences think about this when salespeople forget and forget what they're doing and don't come up with the numbers what do we do we give them a little time maybe we give them some training but then if they don't hit those numbers eventually we fire them however when you start talking about diversity and inclusion we use terms like accountability and maybe we scold and maybe we hold back an incentive or two but you know what the best incentive is a job and you know it the best disincentive is losing it so if companies really want accountability they should assume that that is a given consequences are what happened when you don't do what you're accountable for imagine this imagine a place where people of all colors and all races are on and climbing every rung of the corporate ladder where those people feel safe indeed expected to bring their unassimilated authentic selves to work every day because the difference that they bring is both recognized and respected and imagine a place where the lessons we learn about diversity at work actually transform the things we do think and say outside of work that is what happens if we all work together to fix what's broken that is what happens if we stop praying for change to happen and actually start moving our feet to making it that is the power of single mindedness thank you [Applause]
