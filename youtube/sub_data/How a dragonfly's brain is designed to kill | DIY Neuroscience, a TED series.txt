if I asked you to think of a ferocious killer animal you'd probably think of a lion and for all the wonderful predatory skills that a lion has it still only has about a twenty percent success rate at catching a meal now one of the most successful hunters in the entire Animal Kingdom is surprising the dragonfly if dragonflies are killer flies and when they see a smaller fly they have about a 97 percent chance of catching it for a meal and this is in mid-flight but how can such a small insect be so precise in this episode we're gonna see how the dragonflies brain is highly specialized to be a deadly killer so what makes the dragonfly one of the most successful predators in the animal kingdom one it's the eyes it has near 360-degree vision to the wings with individual control of its wings the drag if I can move precisely in any direction but the real secret of the dragonfly success is how its brain coordinates as complex information between the eyes and the wings and turns hunting into a simple reflex to study this Jamie's been spending a lot of time socializing with dragonflies what do you need to do your experiments first of all you need dragonflies I have a mesh cage to catch the dragonflies the more I worked with them the more terrified I got of them they're actually very scary especially under microscope they have really sharp mandibles are generally pretty aggressive which I guess also helps them to be really good predators now in order to learn what's going on inside the dragonflies brain when it sees a prey we're gonna East drop in on a conversation between the eyes and the wings and to do that we need to anesthetize the dragonfly on ice and make sure we protect its wings so that we can release it afterwards now the dragonflies brain is made up of specialized cells called neurons and these neurons are what allow the dragonfly to see and move so quickly individual neurons form circuits by connecting to each other via long tiny threads called axons and the neurons communicate over these axons using electricity in the dragonfly we replaced little metal wires or electrodes along the axon tracts and this is what's really cool in the dragonfly there's only sixteen neurons that's eight per eye that tell the wings exactly where the target is we've placed the electrode so that we can record from these neurons that connect the eyes to the wings whenever a message is being passed from the edge of the wing our electrode intercepts that conversation in the form of an electrical current and it amplifies it now we can both hear it and see it in the form of a spike which we also call an action potential now let's listen in right now we have the dragonfly flipped upside down so he's looking down towards the ground we're gonna take a pray or what we sometimes call it target in this case the targets got to be a fake fly and we're gonna move it into the drag of flies sights  whoa oh look at that look at that but it's only in one direction oh yes you don't see any spikes when either forward the draw when I come back in our experiments we're able to see that the neuron to the dragonfly fired when we move the target in one direction but not the other now why is that I remember when I said that the dragonfly had near 360-degree vision well there's a section in the eye called the fovea and this is the part that has the sharpest visual acuity and you can think of it as its crosshairs remember what I told you the dragonfly had individual precise control of its wings when a dragonfly sees its prey it trains its crosshairs on it and a longest axons it sends messages only to the neurons that control the parts of the wings that are needed to keep that dragonfly on target so if the prey is on the left of the dragonfly only the neurons that are tugging the wings to the left are fired and if the prey moves to the right of the dragonfly those same neurons are not needed so they're gonna remain quiet and the dragonfly speed soar the prey at a fixed angle is communicated by this crosshairs to the wings and then BOOM dinner now all this happens at a split second and it's effortless for the dragonfly it's almost like a reflex and this whole incredibly efficient process is called fixation but there's one more story to this process we saw the neurons respond to movements but how does the dragonfly know that something really is prey this is where size matters let's show the dragonfly a series of dots [Applause]  oh yeah that's so much more powerfully out of all the sizes we found that the dragonfly responded to smaller targets over larger ones in other words the dragonfly was programmed to go after smaller flies versus something much larger like a bird and as soon as it recognizes something that's prey that poor little fly only has seconds to live today we got to see how the drag of eyes brain works to make it a very efficient killer and let's be thankful that we didn't live 300 million years ago when dragonflies over the size of cats  [Music]
