it's an age-old pursuit of all parents getting their kids to eat their vegetables but getting them to eat cookies or ice cream is relatively easy and that's because our brains prefer sweetness now there's a new technology called optogenetics which may be able to trick our taste buds for instance preferring vegetables or sweets we're gonna try this today using fruit flies  the reason why we experiment with fruit flies is they have a small enough nervous system that gives us a fighting chance to really understand what's going on and believe it or not their taste buds are very similar to ours but before we try to manipulate their taste preferences we need to sort of establish what is the baseline of a fruit fly what does it prefer we call this a control experimental and Spencer's been hard at work doing this okay Spencer let's do our first experiment we want to test to see if fruit flies prefer bananas or broccoli so what do we need to do that experiment so we need the fly pad which is basically an iPad for flies it actually measures the touch you put a fly in each one of these chambers yeah in each chamber also gonna offer them banana and broccoli to see which one they prefer now in order to count the number of times that the fruit fly eats a banana versus the broccoli these chambers have been outfitted with a small electrode that sends data to a computer and so what were your findings on banana versus broccoli I found that the flies visited banana the most so even though both were there just like most kids they choose not to eat the broccoli and they go switch to something sweeter exactly now quick background on how taste works our taste buds are made up of specialized neurons called taste receptors whenever we eat something that triggers a particular taste those taste neurons will fire a signal to the brain now this allows our brain to know what's sweet and what's bitter so when a fruit fly eats a banana it's sweet taste neuron to a fire but when it eats broccoli those same neurons stay pretty quiet but what if we could force those sweet tasting neurons to fire every time the fruit fly eats broccoli we may be able to get the fruit fly too like broccoli as much as he likes banana enter opto genetics this is the revolutionary new tool that's taking neuroscience by storm and in this case opto means light and genetic refers to the fact that these fruit flies have been modified to contain a special gene that makes only certain neurons respond to light in our case we've added a special gene for the sweet receptors now here's the fun part optogenetics means that we can control these special neurons whenever they're exposed to a bright colored light causing them to send messages to the brain in this experiment we're gonna have these modified fruit flies choose between banana and brach vegan only this time every time the fruit fly eats the broccoli we're gonna trigger a big bright red light and when the channels see that red light they're gonna open up they're gonna cause that neuron to fire and the sweet taste message will be sent to the brain so how do you get the Flies out so we're gonna be using a mouth aspirator so it's just two straws put together just a fancy name for a straw alright basically so you're just suck those out yep have you ever sucked up a fly before mmm once or twice yeah here we go you got all four of them okay perfect so you turn on your op dose dimmers here so you got to park the lights right on top of the chambers so now we sit here and we wait for them to to eat broccoli and then the light fires they're gonna think it's tasting something sweet come on oh he's getting closer come on it tastes good now it's about to oh yeah alright alright so now we see that some of these flies are switching over from from the banana to the broccoli exactly and so every time this this light goes off that means that the neurons there think they're tasting something sweet yeah this guy's really going after ya so we saw that we were able to rescue broccoli and make it just as appealing as banana to our fruit flies and were able to replicate these same results in all of our experiments so the question is can we do the same thing in humans well that depends on a number of items first do optogenetic tools even work in humans and that looks like the answer is yes and in fact clinical trials are already being planned that will treat chronic pain blindness using optogenetics and the next question is can we easily trigger a light source so that every time we eat vegetables that it will go off for that I'm afraid at least at this time the answer is still no but today we get to witness just a taste of optogenetics and its amazing potential
