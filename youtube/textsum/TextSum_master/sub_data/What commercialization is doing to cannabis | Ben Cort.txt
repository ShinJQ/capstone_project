Hey look if you guys are anything like me you have found it harder and harder to turn around recently without seeing words like free-range farm-to-table organically produced especially here in Colorado now is we've become more conscientious of the way that we eat in recent years these once unfamiliar words have worked their way into our daily lexicon when we started to pay more attention to the way that the food we were eating interacted with our bodies and with the earth the food industry had to listen and the results have been really powerful now those of you out there from states like Washington and Oregon and of course my fellow Coloradans y'all know what I'm talking about because this is not words like all natural and homegrown are not just being used in our diets there's this whole new industry using this language now you guys know it's weed an industry the taxes sale of about six billion dollars worth of product in 2016 so what if I would have proposed to you that some of what you think you know about this legalized marijuana thing could be wrong listen I get it talking about issues with legal weed is a pretty quick way to get uninvited from the cool kids table I I I know that better than most but I intend to do it anyway first before I get started let me be perfectly clear about one thing my fight is not against the casual adult use of marijuana I don't care about that what I care deeply about is this new industry that is working to convince us that we are consuming something natural while fixing social ills when we aren't so let's start with a little bit of weed 101 cannabis is a plant that grows naturally and has been used within textiles and even traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years Genesis 1:12 even tells us that I have given to you all of the seed bearing plants and herbs to use as such that is the microphone it's got a TV preacher sort of thing  now cannabis is made up of hundreds of different chemicals but what two of those chemicals are by far the most interesting that CBD and THC so CBD is where almost all of the medicinal properties lie it's an incredibly fascinating part of the plant with real potential to help people it also is totally non intoxicating you could take a bath in the stuff while vaping pure CBD and drinking a CBD smoothie and you still couldn't get high I've tried I haven't I haven't that cost a lot of money not now fur is interesting and remarkable a part of the plan is CBD is it actually makes up a really tiny portion of the commercial market the real money is being made in that other chemical in THC so THC is the natural part of the plant that gets you high and before the 1970s cannabis contained less than half of a percent of THC that's was naturally occurring over the last 40 years as we became better gardeners that that percentage of THC started to slowly but steadily rise until recently when the chemists started to get involved so these guys moved grow cycles I'm sorry these guys move cultivation exclusively indoors and they may grow cycles extremely and unnaturally short they also started to use pesticides and fertilizers in some ways that we should be concerned with in fact I was recently talking to a buddy who had just left a job at a commercial grow operation because he was so concerned with the chemicals that he was being asked to interact with some of his fellow employees were actually encouraged to wear hazmat suits while they were spraying their chemical cocktails on the plants with that kind of manipulation the products that are being sold today can contain above 30% THC and our concentrates our concentrates can actually contain above 95% THC a far cry from the natural plant listen this isn't your Grandpa's weed this isn't your dad's weed like like this isn't even my weed if you've ever set foot inside one of the thousands of dispensaries that have sprung up in recent years you know that what we're really selling in them is THC all of the weed that you buy commercially lists exactly how much THC it contains as do our other much more popular products like vape pens coffee ice cream condiments granola gum candy baked goods suppositories and of course Lube pretty much no for real pretty much anything that you can imagine introducing into the human body the vast majority of cannabis that's being sold today it isn't really cannabis its THC in either a pure form or in an extremely high in unnatural concentration to say that we have legalized weed is subtly misleading we have commercialized THC and it's happened really quickly now the reason why the commercial market is so rapidly exploded is because there is a hell of a lot of money to be made in satisfying and increasing our desire to get high and that money is no longer really being made by the mom-and-pop shops so industry groups and corporations groups like the drug policy Alliance the Marijuana Policy Project ArcView investment the cannabis Industry Association they've chased out and helped to chase out a lot of the small-time growers so these cats know that the best way to get us to continue to or to continue to profit off of us if they follow the alcohol industry's 8020 rule as simple as where 80% of the product is consumed by 20% of the consumers the problem users the wealthy white weed lobbyists and seriously they are almost all rich white men they know that we will consume more what they're selling if they jack up the potency they also know that we are more than twice as likely to consume THC regularly if we earn under twenty thousand dollars a year then those who are in over fifty thousand dollars a year in other words the poorer you are the more likely you are to spend your money on their products and in this country income and race are highly correlated one of the reasons that we often hear cited for the legalization of marijuana is that it will help to stop the disproportionate incarceration rates among minorities which is something everybody in this room should be extremely concerned with unfortunately we don't have to look any further than arrest rates for juveniles here in Colorado to counter that argument according to the Colorado Department of Public Safety since we opened retail in 2014 almost all of which are in poor minority neighborhoods we saw an 8% reduction in the arrests of white kids for all weed related activity good on them during that same time period there's a 29 percent increase in the arrests of Hispanic kids for weed related activity and a 58 percent increase in the arrests of black kids for weed related crimes you guys heard that right we are actually arresting more people of color and Colorado than we were prior to commercialization and you're not reading that in the post Colorado Department of Safety legal marijuana coming into focus another big issue that we have is in school suspension rates so schools that are predominantly white that is they have a minority population of 25% or fewer in the first full year of data collection following commercialization these schools had a grand total of a hundred and ninety drug-related suspensions almost all of which are for THC at the same time schools with a minority population of seventy-five to a hundred percent had 801 drug-related suspensions almost all of which were for THC when discussing minority populations one that unfortunately often gets left out of the conversation is the LGTBQ community now members of this community are more than twice as likely to consume THC than those who identify as heterosexual or cisgender they also unfortunately have higher rates of mental illness and suicide according to a study published in 2014 called going to pot we see that the unnaturally high levels of THC found in today's products they actually compound those issues and make them worse unfortunately that seems to matter very little to the folks who are selling these products because as you just saw clearly this is a good consumer base listen man I get it and in many circles legalized marijuana is too much of a sacred cow to question but we need to start this conversation because what's being sold today is not natural and lobbyists and industry are using social justice as a smokescreen so that they can get richer it's my own journey to sobriety that led me to begin questioning a lot of what I was seeing that's kind of one of the things that were taught to do when I left Boulder for the Washington DC area at 12 years old May I was transported into a world where the kind of shoes that you wore mattered more than just about anything else and my family was just too poor to help me play that game so I was faced with a pretty real crisis of identity in this new scene where there's more blacktop than treetops man I just didn't know who I was so I smoked weed for the first time when I was 13 and I loved it I instantly found this social group and and I also just really liked being high like I finally found a way to shut this up I quickly turned to other drugs and alcohol and something just woke up inside of my brain I was a daily user within a couple of months so my addictive use it mirrors many of the stories that I'm sure you've heard before it started out as fun it got scary and then it was just necessary enough said I got wasted for the last time on June 15th of 1996 an iron  thank you and I've spent the last 21 years trying to both put my life back in order as well as trying to find some peace in this world and one of the ways that I've done that is by working inside of nonprofit drug and alcohol treatment for the last 10 years with groups like Phoenix multi-sport the University of Colorado Hospital and now gap the National Association for lesbian gay transgender bisexual treatment providers and their allies even after all of my work on the frontlines and is a former consumer myself I was shocked and pissed when I started to see what commercialization was doing to cannabis because you see our hope for something pure and natural is making it hard for us to see what's really going on and that is that the rich are getting richer on the backs of the poor and lying to our faces the entire time thank you my friends once again I fear that we are allowing industry to take advantage of the most challenged among us in order to turn a profit much like we saw with tobacco and food in years past so when we told the food industry that we understood the impact our choices were having and that we demanded better for ourselves and our families that industry got in the line so is there any reason why we couldn't demand the same thing from this and from future industries who are trying to get a piece of our paychecks what if we made these guys answer some hard questions what if we held them to a higher standard than we are right now because as it stands for many in our community the grass isn't greener on this side of commercialization they've just been sold a bag of goods thank you  I know it's this is a sensitive topic but a very important one so thank you for for bringing this up and helping us explore it you know a lot of folks are gonna are experiencing health benefits from marijuana and cannabis what would you say to that part of the community I'm actually really glad you brought that up I think one of the most important things that we can do right now is to separate out medicinal and especially what's what's happening in some of the advances that are being made using parts of this plant and even some whole plant medicines from the commercial market for THC and that's I think like crucial we got to stop putting them together and we got to say okay here's the part about getting high and here's the part about the medicine  so it sounds like your talks less about being anti cannabis and more about raising awareness about aspects of commercialization is that a fair way to put it yes so I am NOT the anti weed guy I'm the pro logic guy for me to cast stones and listen I'm a drug addict I don't get to do that and I don't want to do that but what's bothering me it was so hard for me it is to see the way that we are like we're just embracing without asking the hard questions when if this was another industry we'd be holding their feet to the fire on some stuff and no I'm not the anti weed guy I'm the pro thought guy so think I don't even care if you're smoking when you do it just as long as you're an adult so long as you're an adult just stink [Applause]
