a few years ago I got a call from the highest-ranking legal official in the state of Georgia the Attorney General that moment was a wake-up call it was 2013 and the city of Atlanta was hosting the final four basketball tournament the AG called to ask if the company that I work for could help sponsor billboards that would be put up around the city as part of an anti-human trafficking campaign he said this was important because sex trafficking spikes with big sporting events and with conventions and the billboards would help to raise awareness now if I'm being honest with you my first inclination was to politely decline let's face it there are thousands of things that corporate America could get involved in sex trafficking seemed a little messy a little bit too difficult something that it's better left for someone else but then I started to understand and learn how big the problem really is and that it's rampant in my company's hometown I lived and worked in Atlanta for years I practice law here and yet I had no idea that the birthplace of my children is among the most prevalent cities for sex trafficking in the u.s. at last report Atlanta's illegal sex trade has generated up to 290 million dollars a year that's more money than the city's illegal gun and drug trade combined so we stepped up and we helped with the billboards but I couldn't help feeling like it wasn't enough the parent and me the mother and me needed to do more I started talking to people about this and inevitably I was surprised because the conversation would turn from curiosity really this happens here to empathy wow we've got to do something about that to blame you're not telling me that every prostitute is a victim are you I mean don't they know what they're getting into I get it I understand why people are confused so to be clear the people that I'm talking about do not choose this life they're forced defrauded or coerced that's actually the legal definition for human trafficking under federal law for adults now when it comes to kids any minor under 18 that's transported facilitated or used for commercial sex is automatically a victim regardless of whether force fraud or coercion is used this crime knows no age gender or socio-economic barrier I'm talking about the 16 year old girl that I met in Washington DC she had been trafficked from the time she was 14 until she was 16 she was a victim of the foster care system and she told me she'd been sold up to five times a day she didn't even know the term human trafficking she thought that it was just a part of her life as a foster care kid sex trafficking also shows up in affluent areas and gated communities and men lure young girls into sex trafficking situations with promises of modeling contracts cell phones sometimes they're just kidnapped right off the street in the u.s. an estimated 200 to 300 thousand girls and boys are anticipated to be used for commercial sex trafficking every year you heard that right girls and boys worldwide the International Labour Organization estimates that up to 1 million children a year are vulnerable for sex trafficking those numbers are huge and so while the billboards are great for raising awareness generally they're just not enough to put it into this problem I believe that if we're going to be serious about sex trafficking we can't legislate or arrest our way out of modern-day slavery if we really want to end sex trafficking in the u.s. we have to systematically educate and target demand and I think the business community is in the perfect position to do just that so sex trafficking is big business and I'm proposing a business plan that starts with the customer and in the sex trade the customer is referred to as a John he is the man that fuels the demand for sex trafficking John's do not fit into neat stereotypes but there is one universal truth no John no buyer no victim so if we want to start to put a dent in sex trafficking we have to get to John and businesses can do that while he's at work there's an organization called businesses ending slavery and trafficking or best for short and when they launched in 2012 they did a study of seattle-based John's and you know what they found out John's our everyday guy's employed at local businesses they range in age from 18 to 84 John's are dads John's have admitted that they buy sex when they are traveling for business when they're going to sporting events or when they're in the military but here's the kicker best study determined that web-based sex buying spikes at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon which means that these John's are likely buying sex in the middle of the workday I believe that there's a way to stop John's in the middle of the workday from buying sex and businesses can do it in 3 simple ways the first is with a policy a policy that clearly says the company prohibits sex buying during work with company resources or on company time that's right I'm saying that your handbook has to specifically give an example that says no sex buying while you're traveling at the international trade show because that's where it's happening now a policy is only as good as its enforcement and it's communication several studies have indicated from johns that the best way to deter them is public humiliation and embarrassment so businesses who catch John's buying sex using company based equipment or company resources but cut them a break or sweep it under the rug and don't fire them are complicit and fueling demand now a policy is one of the best ways to start the second way is educating the workforce businesses can go a long way in simply training their workforce about the signs and the red flags of human trafficking this was my aha moment for how our company could make a big difference our nation's highways airports and truck stops are literally used as modern-day slave routes our company has more than a hundred thousand drivers all over the country all over the world and so it made perfect sense to train them to see the red flags we don't want them jumping out there and doing things on their own so we want them to call a phone number the hotline and let law enforcement intervene so to do this we teamed up with an organization called truckers Against Trafficking this colorado-based organization had web-based support and materials that we gave to our truck drivers that gave them exactly what they needed to spot the red flags like hearing CB chatter on their radios about girls at nearby exits or seeing underaged women emerging from vehicle in the truck stop parking lots when we rolled out his training a few brave drivers admitted they had seen these women knocking on the cabs in the truck stops looking for customers now they said that they weren't buying but they also didn't know enough to make a call and that's what we want them to do tax organization truckers against trafficking also emphasizes the need for men to talk to other men about web-based sex buying and not buying commercial sex they feature men in uniform proudly proclaiming why they don't buy if we're gonna see a cultural shift in this atrocity we need men talking to other men about the underlying issues fueling demand because sometimes johns don't even know that they're purchasing girls who are enslaved which brings me to my final way that businesses can help every business has a special resource or a secret sauce or resource that they can bring to fight human trafficking for example Visa MasterCard and American Express refused to process transactions from backpage.com an online sex site that sold commercial sex to the tune of nine million dollars a month in April of 2018 backpage.com and affiliated websites were shut down and the FBI seized all their assets hiring a survivors is another way that any company can help Randstad an organization that works with companies to find survivors who had need good jobs has an excellent program called higher hope we've used this program we know that it works in addition to training their flight attendants and their airline crew Delta Airlines also offers sky miles through a program called sky wish to survivors to help them escape their traffickers and reunite with their families there are thousands of things that businesses can do they just have to decide what to do to join the fight no one can justify slavery today but I believe it remains one of the greatest civil rights atrocities of our time fortunately the business community is uniquely positioned to help train their employees to enforce policies and to help use their special resources to fight human trafficking and what about you what if you decided to learn the red flags what if you decided to look at the signs that are all around you and make a call there is no penalty for calling law enforcement when you see something that doesn't sit right together we can all protect our children we can educate the workforces around us and improve society where we all live and work with John thank you [Applause] [Music]
