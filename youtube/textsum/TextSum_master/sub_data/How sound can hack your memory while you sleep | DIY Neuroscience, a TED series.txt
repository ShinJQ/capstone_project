who wouldn't love acing a geography exam remembering all the locations of the countries on a map or avoiding embarrassing situations up suddenly forgetting the person's name standing right in front of you it turns out that memory like other muscles in the body can be strengthened and enhanced but instead of practicing with flashcards there may be an interesting way that we can hack our memory while we sleep why do we sleep this has been a question asked since the early days of civilization and while we may not know the exact answer there are a number of really good theories about why we need it sleep is when the brain transfers short-term memories experienced throughout the day into long term memories this process is called memory consolidation and it's the memory consolidation theory that have scientists wondering if we can enhance certain memories over others there was a paper recently in the journal science by Kent poller and his colleagues at Northwestern that seemed to show that this may be true and that piqued our curiosity Jude has been working on a DIY version of this task to see if we can prove memories through the use of sound and sleep so Jude how do you test if we can prove our memories with sleep we the human subject we have a memory game that we have on an iPad and then we make our subject play this game and I remember the images and where they appear on the screen so this is like a memory game used to play with your child which which picture was way exactly and we tie each picture with a sound that represents that picture so if you can see a picture of a car for example anyone's here on the car engine just before you go to sleep we're gonna test you we're gonna see how well do you remember where the pictures are every time you see the picture you're gonna hear the sound and now comes the experiment you're gonna go take a nap  and while you're sleeping we're gonna be recording your aegs and then we wait for them to go into what is called the slow waves key which is the deepest phase of your sleep or it's really hard for you to wake up okay pause so here's some information on sleep there are four stages we have lighter stages of sleep and REM what we're interested is called slow-wave sleep and it gets its name from the electrical signals called delta waves that we record from the brain now this is the part of sleep where scientists believe that memory consolidation can happen in this deep period of sleep we're gonna do something that you don't know that we're gonna do here's where the tricky part comes and we start playing or accuse do you play all the cues from the things okay no the interesting point is we only eat when a play half of them to see if there's a difference so your hypothesis is the one that they were listening to while they're sleeping they're a new better at when they wake up yes exactly when you wake back up and you play the game again do you do better or worse than before a nap what we found is that if we played you a cue during your sleep for example a car you remember the position of that car when you woke back up again but if we didn't tell you the cue during the sleep for example with guitar you'd be less likely to remember that guitar when you woke up the memories that were cued they remembered better than the ones they weren't even though when they woke up they don't remember hearing those yes exactly we asked you know they're sleeping they can't hear it they wake up they do better on those and the ones that you did yeah yeah so maybe yeah it's like magic wood you ran this experiment on 12 people and the results were significant so it's not that you remember things better it's that you forget them less now is a huge skeptic when I first heard that you can do better in a memory task just by playing sounds during sleep but we replicated these experiments for ourselves the facts and memories that we collect throughout the day are very fragile and they're easily lost and forgotten but by reactivating them during sleep even without us being aware it seems like we can make them more stable and less prone to forgetting now that's pretty incredible our brains are still active even when we're not so if you're like me and a bit forgetful perhaps a solution is a pair headphones and a soft couch  [Music]
