we've all heard the annoying sound of mosquito owner here and we will stop at nothing to make it go away now while the sound may be maddening to us perhaps it's music to a mosquitos ears mosquitoes nervous system has almost as many sensory auditory cells as we do but why would they have so many in such a small body and why would they need to be so sensitive to sounds the answer is love [Music] as humans we do a lot to attract each other some are conscious we put on makeup but make sure we smell nice and some are unconscious you may unconsciously point your body or even sit closer to someone you like these are courtship behaviors and a lot of animals have them and mosquitoes are no different so Haley's been spending her summer bravely listening to mosquitoes and what she observed may surprise you so we want to investigate how the mosquitoes make their song so Haley we want to record their wing beads how we're gonna do that we need to tether them and the way to do that is to first anesthetize them in a fridge or a bed of ice and then I transfer them to this petri dish of ice just to get them even more anesthetized next I take an insect pin and what I do is put a tiny little dab of superglue on this pen I want to make sure that I get it on his thorax above his wings so that one he is suspended his wings are still free to move so here's one down it's really hard to catch male mosquitoes in the wild because females are the only mosquitoes that are attracted to humans they feed on human blood and now we can try to get some recordings from them so this is the stand that I use to hold them I like to place it right over the microphone so that I can get a recording of the buzzing that you hear that sound is generated by how fast they're beating their wings this is a male the male's have very bushy antennae they look kind of feathery and they are also much smaller so he's he's flying around 600 hers yep let's try another mosquito as can we try a female mosquitoes  [Music]  so this is a much lower frequency yeah wholly different than the other guy  so is it just because they're two different mosquitoes or is it because they're male and female it's because they're male and female let's find out when let's just verify that bring in another female and see if she sounds like mosquito a or mosquito being yeah  and again she has much lower than the mouth yeah she sounds different  and she spot him she really is yeah that's the females were actually at a much lower pitch they were around 400 Hertz gotcha and all of the females were around that too I noticed that they were much larger than the males so they didn't have to flap their wings as fast to stay in free flight they have larger wings they're flapping slower and you notice that all the females have the same frequency roughly and all the males of the same fruits that's kind of interesting so that must mean something let's see what happens we put the male and the female together so when I put them into the same hearing range I noticed that they were kind of changing their tones it was kind of more dull almost and then when I put it back in my spectrogram to see their interaction they were meeting at the same tone okay pause the males and females are singing you do it meaning that they adjust their wings to be able to produce a common tone you have the male singing up here at G you have the female singing down here at D and when they get together you're saying that they they change the the frequency of their wings such that they come together yeah exactly sort of singer do it  they're communicating with each other to let each other know that they've basically found a potential mate so in other words the female tends to choose a male that best sings her duet and studies have found that if she's pregnant she does even bother so if we can understand the mosquito mating behavior we may be able to disrupt it in the wild and prevent diseases like malaria but for now the next time you hear a mosquito buzzing just pause and remember she may be in love and she may be singing her song and she may be looking for the perfect match [Music]
